Reviewer 1:
Rebuttal Comments: 
The holeReg keeps the address for a new element to be inserted. Instead of adding the new element at the last node, 
the element is kept at the node adddress resides in holeReg; starting from root and modify each level accordingly before reaching to the
final location. This algorithm is presented in section III, the algorithm 1.

Weakness Comments:
1. Yes, we can include and break up these statistics
2."slice" and LUT data come from ISE synthesis tool
3. Will remove all typo

Reviewer 2:
Rebuttal Comments:
In section III/E/3, we discuss the cost for the implementation of hole minimization for different cases. 
Detaild Comments:
The theoritical analysis of cost for hole is at section II/A (Fig 7). The numerical statistics are given at table II and table III
Search operation should be trivial in our design and withour much changing we can do that.
