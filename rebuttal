Reviewer 1:
Rebuttal Comments: 
The holeReg keeps the address for a new element to be inserted. Instead of adding the new element at the last node, 
the element is kept at the node adddress resides in holeReg; starting from root and modify each level accordingly before reaching to the
final location. By this way it preserve the min-heap property. This algorithm is presented in section III, the algorithm 1.

Weakness Comments:
1. Yes, we can include and break up these statistics
2."slice" and LUT data come from ISE synthesis tool
3. Will remove all typo

Reviewer 2:
Rebuttal Comments:
In section III/E/3, we discuss the cost for the implementation of hole minimization for different cases. 
Detaild Comments:
The theoritical analysis of cost for hole is at section II/A (Fig 7). The numerical statistics are given at table II and table III
Search operation should be trivial in our design and withour much changing we can do that.

Reviewer 3:
Rebuttal Comments:
1. 
2.
3. The best way to analyze at application level effectiveness, it is required to deploy the technique into real application.
Unfortunately, we did not have such scople. The performance is highly dependent on input sequence as discussed in section III/E/2. The
performace of Table II and Table III is based on instruction (insert/delete) secuence generated randomly; i.e average case is presented.
