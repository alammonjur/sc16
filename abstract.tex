A heap can be used as a priority queue implementation for a wide variety of algorithms like routing, anomaly prioritization, shortest path search, and scheduling.
A parallel implementation of a heap is expected to offer higher throughput and Quality-of-Service than a serial implementation.
Several parallel solutions have been proposed, but they incur significant hardware cost by producing {\it holes} in a heap via parallel {\it insert-delete} operations. Holes result in an unbalanced, incomplete binary heap, which leads to longer response time.
In this paper, we propose a hardware realization of a pipelined binary heap.
Our proposed technique makes three key contributions.
(1) We provide a {\it hole} minimization technique that forces the tree structure to be a complete binary heap.
This technique reduces the hardware cost by 37.76\% in terms of number of lookup tables (LUTs) and average response time by 4.48\%.
It allows the proposed design to take $O(1)$ time for {\it min-delete} and {\it insert} operations by ensuring minimum wait time between two consecutive operations.
(2) Sharing hardware between two consecutive pipelined levels reduces hardware cost even further by 3.70\%.
(3) We introduce a {\it replacement} operation, which reduces the response time by 30.36\%.
As a result, the proposed technique incurs 78.50\% less overhead while achieving similar performance compared to existing techniques.
